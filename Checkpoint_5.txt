Part 2.5 Checkpoint Questions (write your answers in text)
Answer these in a separate text/Word file or at the end of your lab report:

    a. In your own words, explain how filter is used in getActiveStudents.
        --> The filter function goes through every student in the array and keeps only the students 
            whose isActive value is true. It returns a new array that contains only the active students.

    b. In your own words, explain how reduce is used in calculateAverageGrade.
        --> The reduce function adds up all the students’ grades by starting from 0 and then adding each grade one by one. 
            After that, the total is divided by the number of students to get the average grade.

    c. What TypeScript error do you get if you remove isActive from one of the students in the array?
        --> TypeScript shows an error saying that the property isActive is missing in that student object.

        i. Why is this error helpful before running the code?
            --> It is helpful because it warns us early that our data is incomplete, 
                so we can fix it before the program runs and causes unexpected bugs.

Part 3.4 Checkpoint Questions (Write your answers) 
    1. In JSON.stringify(getActiveStudents(students), null, 2), what does each argument mean? 
        1. First argument: 
            --> The data we want to convert into a JSON string.
        2. Second argument (null): 
            --> A replacer, but using null means “don’t change anything.”
        3. Third argument (2): 
            --> The number of spaces used for indentation to make the JSON easier to read.


    2. If the JSON string is missing the grade field for one student, what could happen 
    when you parse and use it in TypeScript?
        --> The grade will become undefined, which may cause the average calculation to be wrong 
        (for example, result in NaN). TypeScript may also warn that the data does not match the expected type.

Part 5 -- Wrap up Questions (3 Points)
Answer the following questions (in the same document where you wrote previous answers):

    1. What is the difference between a JavaScript object in a .ts/.js file and JSON in a .json file?
        --> A JavaScript object is a real object used inside the program and can contain things like functions, 
        undefined, or other complex values. JSON is only text used for storing or sending data and must follow 
        strict formatting rules.

    2. Why is it better to use a specific type like Student instead of any when working with parsed JSON data?
        --> Using a specific type helps TypeScript check that the data is correct. It warns us if a 
        field is missing or has the wrong type. If we use any, TypeScript cannot help us catch these mistakes.

    3. What are the two main functions used to convert between JSON text and JavaScript/TypeScript objects?
        --> The two functions are:
                JSON.parse() to convert JSON text into an object
                JSON.stringify() to convert an object back into JSON text
